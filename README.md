### churn_prediction.ipynb:
This notebook implements two machine learning classifiers, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree Classifier, to predict customer churn based on various features. The dataset includes attributes such as 'gender', 'Partner', 'Dependents', 'PhoneService', 'MultipleLines', 'InternetService', 'OnlineSecurity', 'OnlineBackup', 'DeviceProtection', 'TechSupport', 'StreamingTV', 'StreamingMovies', 'Contract', 'PaperlessBilling', and 'PaymentMethod'. These classifiers are used to build models that predict whether a customer is likely to churn, helping businesses identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.

### real_estate_price_prediction.ipynb:
This notebook utilizes both Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression models to predict house prices based on features like longitude, latitude, and house age. The linear model provides a straightforward approach to price prediction, while the polynomial model captures more complex relationships between the features and the target variable. This approach enables more accurate price predictions for real estate analysis, providing valuable insights into the housing market.

### Sales Data Analysis Project:
This project involves analyzing sales data from a sample dataset to extract actionable insights. Key features include:
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data.
- Visualizing trends such as sales over time, product line performance, and top-performing regions.
- Analyzing order size distribution and its impact on revenue.
- Examining order status categories and their influence on sales.
The analysis is implemented in Python using Pandas and Matplotlib, offering a foundation for business intelligence and reporting.
